Three cases: Total number of vowels is Zero or Odd or Even

If Zero : Bob wins since no vowel left for Alice to pick
If Odd : Alice removes the entire string, Alice wins
If Even : Alice pics Odd vowels and leaves 1 vowel for Bob, since 1 is odd, that 1 vowel is again left for Alice to pick, so Alice wins

Odd or Even case: Alice wins
Zero case: Bob wins
