// we have keep in mind that EVEN number keep on decreasing and ODD numbers keep on increasing
1. we have to multiply the ODD numbers in the vector to EVEN and push those to the PRIORITY QUEUE subsequently
2. we have to take the top element and calculate the MIN_Val 
3.  we have to take the divide the top element with 2 and push that to the QUEUE
4.  we stop the operations once the TOP element becomes ODD
