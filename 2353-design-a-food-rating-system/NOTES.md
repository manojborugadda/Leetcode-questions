Time complexity:

Constructor: O(n), where n is the length of the input arrays.
changeRating Method: O(log n) for map operations.
highestRated Method: O(log n) for map operations.
Space complexity:

Constructor: O(n), to store mappings.
changeRating Method: O(1), as it uses a constant amount of additional space.
